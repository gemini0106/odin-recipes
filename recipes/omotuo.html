    <h2>Omu-tuo with Groundnut Soup And Chicken Meat</h2>

    <p>Omotuo happens to be one of my favorite meals especially when served with hot groundnut soup 
        and chicken.</p>

    <p>It is not indigenous to a particular tribe but enjoyed by all parts of Ghana. It is popular 
        served with thick groundnut soup and chicken. Omo tuo can be taken as breakfast, launch or 
        supper. For me rice balls goes with palm nut soup with snail meat.</p>
