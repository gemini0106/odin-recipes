    <h2>Banku With Fried Fish And Hot Pepper</h2>

    <p> Banku is a local Ghanaian dish cooked with a amixture of slightly-fermented corn-dough 
        and cassava-dough made into dumpling to 
        serve. It is distinctively Ghanaian.
        Banku is different from any of the Akple product forms indigenous to the Ewes(a tribe in Ghana). 
        It is a Ghanaian dish which is served with soup, 
        okra stew or a pepper sauce with fish.</p>

        <p>Banku is mostly preferred by the people of the Southern Regions of Ghana; the Ewe people, 
        the Fante people and the Ga-Adangbe people but also eaten across the other regions in Ghana. 
        Banku is found throughout Ghana, and is one of the staple foods enjoyed by all tribes in the 
        country although it is mostly associated with the Ewe people of Ghana. 
        The GaDangme (or Ga) people have a softer variation of the food which they call Banku, 
        while the Fante people have a little drier variant of the dish they call ɛtsew.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients Needed For Preparing Banku</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fermented corn dough</li>
            <li>Cassava dough</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps Involved In Preparing Banku</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the corn dough and cassava dough into a bowl. Using the finger tips, 
                    break up any large lumps and mix together</li>
                <li>Add about 750ml or just enough water to mix the dough into a thick fluid consistency.
                    If you get too heavy handed with the water, let the mixture sit for some couple 
                    of minutes. The dough will settle at the bottom. You can then strain off excess water.
                    </li>
                <li>Sieve the mixture to remove excess chuff. </li> 
                <li>Add a pinch of salt and start to cook the mixture on the hob. </li>    
                <li>Gently stir the mixture in a clockwise direction ensuring that as the mixture 
                    starts to thicken up, it is evenly distributed into the mixture. Continue this 
                    action till the mixture has entirely thickened up.</li>   
                <li>Add a bit of boiling water to the banku, cover the pot, lower the heat and let 
                    t steam for about 5 minutes.</li>    
                <li> Stir the banku, mixing well and pressing the banku on the side of the pot as you 
                    tir. Check video illustration. </li>    
                <li>Once the banku changes, colour to off white and it doesn’t have a raw taste, 
                    then the banku is cooked. </li>    
                <li>Dish out the banku</li> 
                <li>Serve the Banku with either okro stew, soup or hot pepper with fried fish.</li>   
          
            </ol>
